# Image-Classification-Deep-learning
we train the data using machine learning - deep learning  models to classifying the predicted image and what class is belong 
 software developers will need to know how to incorporate deep learning models into everyday applications. 
 Anything with a camera will be using an image classification, object detection, and face recognition, and so on, 
 all based on deep learning models. For is user interfaces like Alexa, Cortana, and Google Assistant all powered 
 by speech recognition models will become more and more common. So, in this project, you'll be implementing an 
 image classification application. This app will train a deep learning model on a data set of images, then use the 
 trained model to classify images. First, you'll develop your code in a Jupyter notebook to make sure your training 
 implementation works. Then, you'll convert the code to a Python application that runs from the command line.
